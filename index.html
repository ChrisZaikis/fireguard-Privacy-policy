      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to accuracy,

      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title"><span class="number">8.</span> Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, FireGuard, its owner, and its contributors shall not be liable for any

      </p>

        User resides, unless otherwise required by mandatory consumer protection laws or applicable international
        regulations. Nothing in this Agreement limits any consumer rights granted under the laws of the European Union or
        the national legislation of EU Member States.
